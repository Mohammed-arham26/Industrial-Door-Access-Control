## Overview
A multi-door interlock control system for industrial access management in sensitive environments like cleanrooms and laboratories. The system ensures secure and sequential door operation.

## Features
- 4-door interlock mechanism
- Emergency override functionality
- Status indication via LEDs and buzzers
- DIP switch configurable dependencies

## Tools & Technologies
- AT89C2051 Microcontroller
- Embedded C, Keil ÂµVision IDE
- OrCAD for PCB layout
- NUVOTON ISP tool, Flash Magic

## How It Works
1. User authentication triggers relay-based door control.
2. Interlock logic ensures only permitted door combinations are open.
3. Emergency mode unlocks all doors simultaneously.

## Future Scope
- Integration with RFID/biometric sensors
- Touch-based authentication
- Centralized monitoring
